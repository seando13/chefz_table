You may be asking yourself what exactly is Chefz Table?

Chefz Table is an online network of certified, professional chefz providing on-site meal preparation and individual or group cooking classes from the comfort of your home. Simply search through the chefz on offer to find the best match for you and your friends. Then settle in for a night of entertainment, learning, and an experience you will remember for years.

We have a multitude of chefz, that are well versed in multiple cuisines. They are here to provide you a safe learning environment and you have the opportunity to ask as many questions as you want with an expert. We believe that food is a way to bring people together. Another benefit of Chefz Table is that it works on your time schedule. During the lessons you will learn new terminology, basic skills, be introduced to new ideas, improve the timing of elements of your meal, and expand your existing palate.

After signing into the service you can view the chefz that we have on offer. As of right now it has placeholders of the pre-eminent culinary experts in the world. However, this gives you a sense of what it may look like in a finished product.

## Objectives of Project 1
- Models: There should be at least three
- This app has: Users, Cuisines, and Booking model with a bonus join table between Users and Cuisines.
- Views: Use partials to DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) up your views.
- Handles invalid data. Forms in your application should validate data and handle incorrect inputs. Validate sign up information, verify valid email addresses and secure passwords.
- Use Gems: Use a GEM that talks to an API to add functionality to your app. 'bootstrap', 'jquery-rails', and 'cloudinary' were installed.
- User Login: There is a login for site, although can be viewed without one.
- Heroku: This app has been uploaded to Heroku.
